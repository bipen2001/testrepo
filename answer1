Q1) what is a repository? and how it is different from a branch?
Ans=> 
A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.


A branch is a version of your repository, or in other words, an independent line of development.

A repository can contain multiple branches, which means there are multiple versions of the repository
